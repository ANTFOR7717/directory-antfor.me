Why I made it:
I was experimenting with automation, and how to make my workflow even more efficient. I decided that since I often spend
most time behind a terminal or IDE, a program that can quickly transition me to a website with little supervision was
the most ideal solution. I used selenium to automate my web keystrokes and python as the main language. I now very
frequently use this to save time while transitioning.
